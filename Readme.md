# Secure Blockchain Integration (Healthcare Systems)

Faculty : Ms. Sowmiya B

**E-Healthcare system in cloud computing using blockchain and medchain technology to protect user data.** 

### System Architecture

- Our system will store all the patients data on the Cloud Network.
- There will be different nodes:
    - Patient’s Node
    - Provider’s Node
- There will be a key associated with every medical record, If we want to share the patient’s data then patient needs to share the key to access the medical records.
- The data stored in cloud is encrypted using asymmetric keys.

```
Cloud Structure : To store the data of the patients.
|
|
Blockchain : To create a safe access to the EMR using keys.
|
|
Nodes : To fetch the data from the Blockchain.
```

### Creating an Architecture

- Blockchain Smart Contracts
- Cloud Integrations
